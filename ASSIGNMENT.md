# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> The entire experience is very difficult for me. Without commenting, there are a lot of issues that confused me. First of all, I have no idea what is the data type for the parameter so I have to search in the file where the function is being called. Once I found the function being called, I can guess the data type based on the input parameter. However, sometimes the input parameter is a variable without data type specified. Therefore, I had a hard time figuring out what data type the parameter is. It will be easier if more examples are given. 



##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> "raise the level of abstraction" means explain "what" instead of "how". When writing comments, I understand that it is essetial to describe what this function is doing instead of how it is going to do since it is not helpful and may be hard to undersatnd. I will tell cs142 student to explain "what" instead of "how" for commenting.


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> I spent more than 24 hours in this assignment.


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I received help from Sophie and Joel.


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> I think there are too many parts in this assignment and I spent three days working on this assignment and I am still not sure if the way I am doing is right.
I think it will be better if we can have clearer instructions (for example, there are functions inside functions, do we need to comment all the functions? Also, there are functions that do not return things, do we need to write return for that kind of functions?)
I read the guidline for commenting so many times but there are many situations that are not specified or even mentioned. I googled a lot but I can barely find related examples so I think it will be helpful if we can have more examples/help.
